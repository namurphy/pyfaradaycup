"""Contains the main function for the decommutator."""

# The original version of this file from /psp/code on fc was swp_spc_l02l1.py,
# which was run as a script.

# While the decommutator step goes from level 0 (L0) to level 0.5 (L05 or L0.5),
# the software and filenames has sometimes used level 1 (L1) for level 0.5.

# The following are relic comments from the previous file.

# Purpose: Convert binary "level-zero" or "ssr" files that come from the SWEM or Spacecraft
#         into L0.5 CDF files

# Requirements: Must have a reference to a skeleton file for the ApID that you wish to convert_one

# Input: path to a binary L0 file

# Output: saves a CDF file

# Revision History
# 	2020/02/03	-	Fix timing bug in 0x351 that arose when switching to spiceypy.  Add capability to produce 0x352 (time series) files.  Will require update to 0x352 (time series) skeleton also.  Update bug in naming of L1 files coming from gzip (spacecraft files, probably).  Remove versioning from skeleton files (since SVN is taking care of that).
# 	2020/01/29  -   Use spiceypy to adjust time of each measurement to SCET; remove unused command-line argument options
# 					Change method by which newest skeleton files are found; various other cleanups
# 	2019/08/27	-	Calling new ccsds_reader that separates out s/c from instr. packets
# 				-	Also, new ccsds_reader will use new packet finder (much faster), and does not scan through packets like before
# 	2019/08/23	-	Fixed bug that was reading in the oldest rather than newest skeleton file
# 				-	Added capability to read 0x081 and 0x262 packets from s/c hsk files.  Requires link to SC_HK.blk block definition file
# 				-	Added revision history

    Convert one SPC L0 file into L0.5 CDF files, one per APID.

    Parameters
    ----------
    l0file : str or path-like
        Path to the L0 file to convert.

    l05dir : str or path-like, optional
        Directory for the L0.5 CDF files. If `None` (the default), the
        current directory is used. It is created if it does not exist.

    logdir : str or path-like, optional
        Directory for the log file. If `None` (the default), the current
        directory is used. It is created if it does not exist.

    spacecraft : bool, optional
        If `True`, read spacecraft housekeeping packets with
        `~pyfaradaycup.decommutator.ccsds_reader_pipeline.read_file_sc`.
        If `False`, read SWEAP instrument packets with
        `~pyfaradaycup.decommutator.ccsds_reader_pipeline.read_file`.

    ptp : bool, optional
        If `True`, the L0 file is a PTP file. Only used when
        ``spacecraft`` is `True`.

    gzip : bool, optional
        If `True`, read the L0 file as gzip-compressed.

    apidreq : int, optional
        Only create a CDF for this APID. If ``0``, create a CDF for
        every supported APID found in the file.

    overwrite : bool, optional
        If `True`, replace L0.5 CDF files that already exist. If `False`
        and a file already exists, a `FileExistsError` is raised.

    verbose : bool, optional
        If `True`, print messages to the screen as well as to the log
        file.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``l0file`` is not provided.

    FileExistsError
        If an L0.5 CDF file already exists and ``overwrite`` is `False`.

    RuntimeError
        If the log file cannot be opened, the SPICE kernels cannot be
        loaded, or the L0 file cannot be read.

    Notes
    -----
    Errors for a single APID do not stop the conversion. If the
    skeleton file cannot be read, the CDF cannot be created, or the CDF
    cannot be filled, the error is logged and the next APID is
    processed. A CDF that could not be filled may be left behind.

    """
    Fill a CDF with housekeeping data, one row per packet.

    This handles SPC housekeeping packets (APIDs 0x35E and 0x35F) and
    the spacecraft housekeeping packets that `main` sends here
    (APIDs 0x081, 0x1DE, 0x254, 0x256, 0x257, and 0x262).

    Parameters
    ----------
    cdf : spacepy.pycdf.CDF
        The L0.5 CDF file to write the data into.

    dat : dict of str to list
        Decoded L0 data for one APID, with one entry per packet for
        each mnemonic.

    verbose : bool, optional
        Not currently used. Accepted so that `main` can call each CDF
        writer with the same arguments.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If a variable cannot be written to the CDF, such as when the
        data has the wrong shape or type for that variable.

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike `_cdf352` and `_cdf351_353_354`, the data is not expanded:
    each packet becomes one row in the CDF.

    ``"Epoch"`` (nanoseconds past J2000) is calculated from whichever
    MET fields ``dat`` contains: ``"CCSDS_MET"`` for SPC packets, or
    one of several ``*_TPSH_MET_SEC`` fields for spacecraft packets.
    If none are found, an error is logged and nothing is written.
    ``"Epoch"`` is also added to ``dat``.

    Each variable in the CDF is filled from the matching key in
    ``dat``. Variables with no matching key are filled with the
    variable's ``FILLVAL``.

    Expand SPC science packets (APIDs 0x351, 0x353, 0x354) and write them to a CDF.

    Each packet holds all the measurements from one NY second. This
    function gives every measurement its own timestamp and puts each
    variable into a flat array. APID 0x351 holds AllGain (ALL) data,
    0x353 holds SCI data, and 0x354 holds RSS data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cdf : spacepy.pycdf.CDF
        The L0.5 CDF file to write the data into. Not used if ``nocdf``
        is `True`.

    dat : dict of str to list
        Decoded L0 data for one of these APIDs, with one entry per
        packet for each mnemonic. Must include ``"CCSDS_ApID"``,
        ``"CCSDS_MET"``, ``"SW_SPCSUBSEC"``, ``"SW_SPC_INTTIME"``,
        ``"SW_SPC_SERVTIME"``, ``"WINDOW"``, and the variable that
        sets the number of measurements (``"A1S"``, ``"ASIN"``, or
        ``"ARSS"``). APID 0x351 also needs ``"SW_SPC_PKTNUM"``.

    nocdf : bool, optional
        If `True`, return the expanded data instead of writing it to
        ``cdf``.

    verbose : bool, optional
        If `True`, print warnings and errors to the screen as well as
        to the log file.

    Returns
    -------
    dict of str to list or None
        If ``nocdf`` is `True`, the expanded data, with one value per
        measurement for each key. Otherwise, `None`.

    Expand SPC time series (APID 0x352) packets into L0.5 data and write them to a CDF.

    Each 0x352 packet holds many fast measurements from one NY second,
    for four channels at a time. This function gives every measurement
    its own timestamp and puts each channel into a flat array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cdf : spacepy.pycdf.CDF
        The L0.5 CDF file to write the data into. Not used if ``nocdf``
        is `True`.

    dat : dict of str to list
        Decoded L0 data for APID 0x352, with one entry per packet for
        each mnemonic. Must include ``"CCSDS_MET"``, ``"SW_SPCSUBSEC"``,
        ``"SPC_TIMESERCOLL"``, ``"SPC_TIMESERTICK"``, and the
        measurement arrays ``"G0_000"`` through ``"G3_000"``.

    nocdf : bool, optional
        If `True`, return the expanded data instead of writing it to
        ``cdf``.

    verbose : bool, optional
        If `True`, print error messages to the screen as well as to the
        log file.

    Returns
    -------
    dict of str to list or tuple
        If ``nocdf`` is `True`, the expanded data, with one value per
        measurement for each key. Otherwise, an empty tuple.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If an unexpected error occurs while expanding the packets.

    Notes
    -----
    ``"SPC_TIMESERCOLL"`` sets which four channels a packet contains:
    ``1``, ``2``, ``4``, and ``8`` for the A, B, C, and D collectors
    (channels 0-3), and ``16`` and ``32`` for two sets of housekeeping
    voltages. The values go into ``"VAR0"`` through ``"VAR3"``, and the
    channel names go into ``"VAR0_NAME"`` through ``"VAR3_NAME"``.
    Packets with any other value are logged as errors and skipped.

    Unlike `_cdf351_353_354`, if a variable cannot be written to the
    CDF, the error is logged and the remaining variables are still
    written.

    ``"Epoch"`` is in nanoseconds past J2000. Each measurement is
    spaced ``1 / (32 * 1171.875)`` seconds apart, starting at the
    packet's start tick. Values that appear once per packet are
    repeated for every measurement in that packet.

    Convert MET seconds and subseconds to ephemeris time in nanoseconds.

    The conversion uses the PSP spacecraft clock through SPICE.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sec : list of int
        MET whole seconds, from the first 4 bytes of the CCSDS time
        field.

    subsec : list of int
        MET subseconds, from the next 2 bytes of the CCSDS time field.

    spacecraft : bool, optional
        If `True`, ``subsec`` is in units of 1/256 second, as used in
        spacecraft packets. If `False`, ``subsec`` is in units of
        1/65536 second, as used in SWEAP packets.

    Returns
    -------
    list of float
        Ephemeris time for each input, in nanoseconds past J2000,
        rounded to the nearest nanosecond.

    Notes
    -----
    The subseconds are rescaled to the 1/50000 second ticks used by
    the PSP clock kernel, and each time is converted with
    ``spiceypy.scs2e`` using NAIF ID -96 (PSP). The PSP clock (SCLK)
    and leap second kernels must already be loaded.
