# Decommutator

This directory contains the code that converts Parker Solar Probe SPC L0 files into L1 CDF files.

- `main.py` defines the `pfc_decommutator` command line tool.
- `swp_spc_l0_to_l05.py` defines `main`, which does the conversion for one L0 file.
- `ccsds_reader_pipeline.py` reads the CCSDS packets from an L0 file.

## Changes needed for use in a Dagster pipeline

`pfc_decommutator` can be run from Dagster as it is, but a step that fails can be reported as a success, and retries and parallel runs are not safe.
The changes below are listed with the most important first.

### Report every failure as a failure

Dagster decides whether a step succeeded from the exit code of a subprocess, or from whether a Python call raised an exception.

- **Stop skipping APIDs that fail.**
  When a skeleton file is missing, or when writing a CDF fails, `main` logs a message and moves to the next APID, and the run still ends with "Script complete".
  Collect these failures and raise an exception at the end if there were any.

### Return what was written

`swp_spc_l02l1.main` returns `None`.
It should return the paths of the L1 CDF files it wrote, and the path of the log file, so that a Dagster asset can check its outputs and attach them as metadata without searching the output directory.
It would also be useful to return the kernels and skeleton files that were used.

### Make retries and parallel runs safe

- **Write each CDF to a temporary file, and rename it when it is complete.**
  CDF files are currently written in place, so a run that stops part way leaves an incomplete CDF file behind.
- **Decide what a retry should do.**
  Without `--overwrite`, a retry stops at the first L1 file that already exists.
  A Dagster step should either always overwrite, or skip files that are already complete.
- **Give each run its own log file name.**
  The log file name contains the time to the nearest second, and the file is opened for writing.
  Two runs that start in the same second with the same `--logdir` write to the same file.
  Including the name of the L0 file in the log file name would fix this.
- **Remove the global state.**
  The log file is the module-level global `logfile`, which `_statusmsg` writes to.
  SPICE kernels are loaded with `spiceypy.furnsh` on every call and are never unloaded.
  This is safe when each step runs in its own process, but not when `main` is called more than once in the same process.
  Pass the log file as an argument, and unload the kernels when the conversion finishes.

### Make it callable from Python

Calling the conversion as a function is better suited to Dagster than starting a subprocess, since Dagster can then capture exceptions, log messages, and return values.

- **Use the `logging` module instead of `_statusmsg` and `print`.**
  Dagster can then show the messages with their levels in its own logs.
  The warnings that `pfc_decommutator` prints for options that have no effect should use `logging` too.
- **Keep `pfc_decommutator` as a thin wrapper.**
  A click command ends the Python process when it finishes, so it should not be called from an asset or op.
  All checks that matter should be in the function that the asset calls.

### Make the inputs configurable

- **Allow the kernel, skeleton, and housekeeping definition files to be chosen.**
  The leap second kernel, SCLK kernel, CDF skeletons, and `sweap_tlm.blk` are read from the `data` directory of the installed package, and the newest kernel is chosen from the file name.
  With `--spacecraft`, the list of flight software versions (`sc_hsk/L1/APID257_combined.txt`) and the spacecraft housekeeping definitions (`sc_hk_def/`) are read from there too.
  These are copies of files on the server used to process the data, so they go out of date when the server's files are updated.
  A new SCLK kernel or flight software version therefore needs a new installation of the package, and Dagster cannot treat these files as inputs.
  Add arguments for these paths, with the packaged files as the default.

### Test the `--spacecraft` option

- **Add a test that converts a spacecraft L0 file with `--spacecraft`.**
  The only test converts an instrument L0 file, so `read_file_sc`, `_get_layout_sc`, and the code that writes the spacecraft housekeeping CDFs are never run.
  Add a spacecraft L0 file to `tests/data`, along with the expected L1 CDF files, and compare them as the existing test does.
  Include a file for which the flight software version cannot be found from the packet header, so that the fallback to the file path, and then to the newest definition file, is also tested.

### Remove options that do nothing

- `--batch`, `--recursive`, and `--l0dir` do not convert any additional files, and `--stcorrect` raises an error.
  Dagster should start one step for each L0 file, for example with partitions, so batch processing is not needed in this tool.
- `--ptp` only has an effect together with `--spacecraft`.
